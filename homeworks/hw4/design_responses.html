					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned about a lot of resources I can use to make my website more accessible.
								I also learned a lot of the terms that I previously had known the concepts of, for example
							contrast. I always knew that I liked certain colors and backgrounds more than others, but I 
						didn't know why or what to call it, and now I know! </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I like how the author includes pictures of what to do and what not to do because
								I can't really picture the descriptions by themselves in my head. So the pictures are nice
								so I have an example.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Lastly, the most important aspect of creating an accessible color system is giving your team the ability to reference it when needed, so everyone is clear about proper usage." </p>
						</li>
