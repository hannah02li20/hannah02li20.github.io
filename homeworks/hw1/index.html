<p>Hello. I am taking this class to make nice websites. And for units.

        I learned that I should study the apps I use to become a better designed.
        I should notice how the app draws my focus and highlights information they think is important.

        My favorite part of the article is the pictures and how I could actually see what the author was talking about.
        When she mentioned her observations, I could go back and see them too.

        "When I started off in design, I sucked."
         This is my favorite quote from the article because I also currently suck at design.
