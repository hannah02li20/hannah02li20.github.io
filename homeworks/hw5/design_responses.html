                            <p> There wasn't text, but I learned about all the ways that a message can be conveyed. Even the same 
                                message can be conveyed differently through different websites.  </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I liked all the different websites and app examples that I saw. I liked how simple the first ones were
                                and yet so different. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> I enjoyed the architecture one by Alina Lichinister, because it portrayed everything very linearly, like an architect would.
                                So it kind of mirrored the work it was advertising, which I thought was very cool. I also liked the use of primary colors 
                            because it drew my eye and was what made me notice it in the first place. </p>
