						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that white space can be used to draw attention to the things that
								I want to really showcase, or to emphasize a call to action. 
								It can also be used to form groups through the distance between images.
								It can also increase readability by not overwhelming the viewer.
								Most importantly, I learned that white space is NOT wasted space. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was the pictures. I didn't really understand
								what the author meant through writing alone, but when I went to take a look
								at the example they provided, I saw what they meant. So I really like how the 
								author included exmaples to make their point more clear.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "On a typical e-commerce page, a product designer is faced with the challenge of balancing multiple calls to action, secondary links, imagery, pieces of copyâ€”the list goes on." 
								I like this quote because it talks about reality and I like the insight into the authors job.
